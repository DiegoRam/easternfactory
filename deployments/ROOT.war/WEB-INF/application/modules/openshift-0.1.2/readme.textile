h1. Openshift Module for Play! Framework Applications

Openshift is Red Hat's free, auto-scaling, cloud-based platform-as-a-service for Java, Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby applications.

With this module, you'll be able to easily deploy and manage your play application on Red Hat's cloud platform. 

The module does not depend on any external Java libray. You'll just need an openshift account, git and openshift command line tools installed on your workstation.
